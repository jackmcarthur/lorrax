# Known test failures — full-suite census

Two censuses live in this file.  The **Perlmutter** one is authoritative for
this tree; the **Frontera** one below it is the historical record from
2026-08-01 and is kept because several of today's reds are only legible
against it.

A release ships LISTED known-fails, never unknown ones: every non-passing
test in every leg is accounted for below, and every "it is the environment"
claim carries the arm in which it comes out FALSE.

# Perlmutter census — `svc/distrib_la-2026-08-07` @ `d5cac09` (2026-08-07)

**First Perlmutter full-suite census in this tree.**  The Frontera census
below was the only one that existed, and three of its "fixed in this pass"
re-freezes turn out to be *platform-local* — see class **P1**.

## Verdicts by leg

| leg | invocation | collected | passed | failed | error | skipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** full suite, services deselected | `lx test -- tests/ --no-services -q -rs -p no:randomly` | 1191 | 1120 | 8 | 1 | 62 |
| **A2** full suite WITH services | `lx test -- -q -rs -p no:randomly` (testpaths = tests + services) | 1441 | 1326 | 9 | 22 | 84 |
| **B** full-suite marker leg | `lx test -- -m distrib_la -q -rs` | 130 | 108 | 0 | 0 | 22 |
| **E** lxkit by path | `lx test -- services/lxkit/tests -q -rs` | 120 | 120 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **E2** distrib_la by path | `lx test -- services/distrib_la/tests -q -rs` | 130 | 127 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| **C** device-hungry, 4 emulated host devices | `lx run env XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4 JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu python3 -m pytest <9 files>` | 146 | 143 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| **C2** non-square refusal, 3 emulated devices | `… device_count=3 … -k nonsquare` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **C3** two-device cells | `… device_count=2 … tests/test_charge_zeta_route.py` | 15 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| **D** `extra` tier | `lx test -- -m extra -q -rs` | 26 | 23 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| **F** L-c REAL 4-process CPU 2×2 | `lx run -N 1 -G 4 -n 4 env JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu python3 …test_distrib_la_multiproc.py --mesh 2x2` | 14 cells | 12 | **0** | 0 | 2 |
| **G** L-c REAL 4-process GPU 2×2 | `lx run -N 1 -G 4 -n 4 … --mesh 2x2` (serialized) | 13 cells | 10 | **0** | 0 | 3 |

Legs F and G are the hostile-geometry / real-multi-process tier and are the
only legs that exercise ScaLAPACK, SLATE and cuSOLVERMp on four real ranks.
Both are clean; their residuals are quoted in
`docs/services/distrib_la.md` § Performance.

### Isolation and falsification legs (not census legs — evidence)

| leg | invocation | result | what it settles |
|---|---|---|---|
| `iso_reds` | every leg-A red, ONE process, `lx run … -m pytest` | 58 / **54 P / 4 F** | 4 of the 9 leg-A reds survive isolation; 5 do not |
| `iso_bse` | the five BSE session files, ONE process | 35 / **35 P** | the A2 21-error cascade is not per-test |
| `xdist_arm` | the SAME six files under `lx test` (xdist, 4 workers) | 24 / 7 P / **17 E** | the cascade is the LAUNCHER |
| `base_xdist` | `xdist_arm` at the branch base `96a6399` | 24 / **24 P** (2 runs) | the cascade is a REGRESSION ON THIS BRANCH |
| `falsify_wfnloader` | `test_no_ffi_at_P_gt_1…` with the FFI pins UNSET | **1 P** | that red is the pin |
| `falsify_aot` | `device.memory_stats()` under `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=platform` vs `=bfc` | `None` vs a 10-key dict | that red is the allocator |
| `bisect_fileio` | `tests/test_file_io.py` on the CPU platform at `96a6399` / `b3f3675` / `32e61fe` / HEAD | 42P·1S / 42P·1S / **ABORT** / **ABORT** | names the commit |
| `loadorder` | HEAD, CPU platform, `LORRAX_FFI_SO` unloadable vs pinned | **42P·1S** vs ABORT | names the LINE |
| `bisect_xdist` | `xdist_arm` at `78ddcee` / `6920171` | 24/24 P vs 11P·2F·11E | names the second commit |
| `cvd_probe` | each xdist worker prints its own `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, at `78ddcee` and at HEAD | `0,1,2,3` vs `0,0,0,0` | names the mechanism |

## SHIP-LISTED FAILURES

### **B1 — BLOCKER, new on this branch: `_open_cuda_before_host` breaks the host phdf5 path**

| | |
|---|---|
| tests | `tests/test_file_io.py` — `test_read_slab_without_shape_rounds_up_to_the_mesh`, `test_slabio_implicit_pad_write_and_zero_padded_read` and every SlabIO write cell after them, on any leg whose jax platform resolves to **cpu** |
| class | (a) real defect, introduced by this branch |
| covering leg | none — the GPU legs (A/A2) do not reach it, the CPU leg dies in it |

`src/ffi/common/ffi_loader.py:576-613` (commit **`32e61fe`**, "the two FFI
libraries share their SLATE, and the first one opened wins") makes
`get_lib("cpu")` call `_open_cuda_before_host()`, which `dlopen`s the CUDA
FFI library `RTLD_GLOBAL` first.  That is correct for SLATE — and it is
measured — but in a process whose jax backend is **cpu** the host phdf5 slab
handlers are then answered across the SONAME boundary.  Symptom at the
handler: the read refuses with

    phdf5 read: logical slab out of bounds
      extent=[2,4,1,6]
      offset_base=[0,0,0,4596944070643295330]
      valid_shape=[3,6,6,4609783128842618077]

Those two integers are IEEE-754 float64 bit patterns (≈0.19 and ≈1.87) read
as `int64` — a different handler's argument layout, which is what "the wrong
library answered" looks like.  Where it does not refuse, it aborts inside
the async writer thread (`common/async_io.py:135` → `_slab_io_ffi.py:1749` →
pjit → `Fatal Python error: Aborted`).

**BISECT, one fast deterministic leg (`tests/test_file_io.py`, CPU platform,
4 emulated host devices), all four arms on the same pins:**

| commit | | result |
|---|---|---|
| `96a6399` | branch base | 42 passed / 1 skipped |
| `b3f3675` | the commit *before* the load-order rule | 42 passed / 1 skipped |
| `32e61fe` | **the load-order rule** | 3 failed, then `Fatal Python error: Aborted` |
| `d5cac09` | HEAD | hang → 300 s wall |

**FALSIFICATION (the arm where the hypothesis comes out false), at HEAD:**
point `LORRAX_FFI_SO` at a path that cannot be `dlopen`ed, so
`_open_cuda_before_host`'s best-effort `get_lib("CUDA")` raises and is
swallowed and the process stays host-only — **42 passed / 1 skipped**, byte
for byte the base result.  Same leg with the CUDA `.so` pinned: 300 s wall.

**OWNER / FABLE DECISION — this should block landing as it stands.**  The
rule it implements is real (it unblocked 8 SLATE-CUDA cells, `32e61fe`'s
own evidence stands), so the fix is not "revert": it is to make the
pre-open conditional on the process actually being able to use CUDA — a
CPU-platform run has no SLATE-CUDA work to protect and pays the whole host
path for it.  `services/distrib_la/src/distrib_la/loader.py` carries the
same rule and `test_distrib_la_contract.py:1476,1502,1513` +
`test_so_acceptance.py:278` pin it, so the change is four files and four
cells, not one line.  **Not taken here**: undoing an evidenced fix at the
land gate is the Fable's and the owner's call, not the census's.

### **B2 — the xdist launcher: the gnppm session dies at the SlabIO drain**

| | |
|---|---|
| tests | leg A: `test_bse_bgw_regression::test_bse_matches_frozen_and_bgw`, `test_bse_w0_resolvent::test_wq_resolvent_matches_restart_finite_q`, `test_restart_pad_roundtrip::test_restart_mu_pad_roundtrip` (worker crash).  Leg A2: those plus `test_bse_kgrid` (2) and a 21-error cascade over `test_bse_dense_reference` (12), `test_bse_stack_matvec` (3), `test_bse_w_omega_chain` (2), `test_bse_matvec_opts` (2), `test_bse_w0_resolvent` (2) |
| class | (a) real defect, new on this branch — **root-caused to `6920171`**, second symptom layered on at `32e61fe` |
| covering leg | the SINGLE-PROCESS leg: `iso_bse` **35/35 pass**, `iso_reds` passes all of these |

Every one of these cells is green in one process and red under `lx test`
(1 node, all GPUs, 4 xdist workers, one GPU pinned per worker).  The
session fixture dies with no traceback immediately after

    [restart_write] W0_qmunu (9, 399, 399) 0.02 GB QUEUED in 0.0 s
    [SlabIO.close] draining 1 pending writes for isdf_tensors_399.h5 …

and, separately, reads come back
`ValueError: INVALID_ARGUMENT: phdf5 read: ctx_handle is null`.

MEASURED, same six files, same launcher, same pins, two runs per arm:

| commit | result |
|---|---|
| `96a6399` (base) | 24 / **24 passed** |
| `b3f3675` | 8 passed / 16 error — but `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Failed to allocate 19.9 GiB on device ordinal 0` |
| `d5cac09` (HEAD) | 7 passed / 17 error — the SlabIO drain death |

TWO regressions are stacked here.  Both are now root-caused.

**The memory one is `6920171` ("tests/conftest: the GPU pin was conditional
on xdist, and that hid a leg"), and it puts EVERY xdist worker on GPU 0.**
Bisected on the same arm, then measured directly with a throwaway probe
test that prints its own `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (written into the clone for
one run, deleted; both trees verified clean afterwards):

| commit | gw0 | gw1 | gw2 | gw3 | xdist arm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `78ddcee` (before) | `'0'` | `'1'` | `'2'` | `'3'` | 24 / **24 passed** |
| `6920171` (after) | `'0'` | `'0'` | `'0'` | `'0'` | 11 P / 2 F / 11 E, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED … 19.20GiB on device ordinal 0` |
| `d5cac09` (HEAD) | `'0'` | `'0'` | `'0'` | `'0'` | 7 P / 17 E |

MECHANISM.  The pin used to be written only when `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER`
started with `gw`.  Unconditional, the xdist **controller** — which has no
worker id, so `pin_one_gpu` returns `devs[0]` — now writes
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"` into its OWN environ at `tests/conftest.py`
module scope.  The workers inherit that environ, so each of them sees
`preset="0"`, `_visible_gpus` returns a ONE-element list, and
`int(worker_id[2:]) % 1 == 0` for all four.  The fan-out
`tests/harness.py:54-78` documents is dead, and four gnppm sessions land on
one 40 GiB A100 instead of four.

`pin_one_gpu` itself is correct and its unit tests pass — they construct
the preset by hand and never see the controller's write.  The gap is the
caller, and `tests/test_gpu_pinning.py` is where the twin belongs: *four
worker ids must map to four distinct devices even when the controller has
already pinned one*.

**OWNER / FABLE DECISION — this should block landing.**  `6920171` fixed a
real thing (the non-xdist leg was unpinned, and that hid a leg); the fix is
to stop the controller's write from becoming the workers' preset, not to
revert.  **Not taken here** for the same reason as B1.

> The compile cache is NOT the cause of the `ctx_handle is null` reads.
> Arm run: same files with `ISDF_JAX_CACHE_DIR=""` → 4 passed; but the
> control (cache ON, same isolation) is *also* green, so the arm is not
> discriminating and the cache hypothesis is unsupported.  Recorded so
> nobody re-derives it.

### **P1 — three Tier-1 pins are Frontera-frozen and cannot be green on both machines**

| tests | class | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `test_gw_jax_regression::test_gnppm_matches_reference` | (c) stale/relocated pin | 20 / 2484 rows, **max abs diff exactly 1.000e-6 eV** against `atol=1e-6` |
| `test_gw_jax_regression::test_bispinor_gnppm_matches_reference` | " | 24 / 1620 rows, **max abs diff exactly 1.000e-6 eV** |
| `test_sigma_ppm_gates::test_g2_branch_window_tiles_are_frozen` | " | crossing-core node ladder is **100** here, the frozen array is **98** |

The Frontera census (`f485b5a`, 2026-08-01, job 7885154) re-froze all three
from Frontera CLX output.  Its own KNOWN_FAILURES row said the drift was
"EXACTLY one unit in the 6th printed decimal … 20/2484 resp. 24/1620 rows".
This census measures the same rows, the same 1-ULP size, in the other
direction — because the reference `f485b5a` *replaced* is what Perlmutter
produces:

    sigma_diag_gnppm_ref.dat     n=12  sigC=  4.771156   (pre-f485b5a)   == today's ACTUAL
                                       sigC=  4.771155   (f485b5a)       == today's DESIRED
    sigma_diag_bispinor_ref.dat  n=10  sigXC=-16.978381  (pre-f485b5a)   == today's ACTUAL
                                       sigXC=-16.978382  (f485b5a)       == today's DESIRED

Nothing on this branch moved them: the WSL full-suite red-set diff over the
whole branch (`96a6399` → `d5cac09`) is empty in both directions.

**OWNER DECISION.**  A 6-decimal `.dat` at `atol=1e-6` has no room for a
cross-platform ULP, so "re-freeze on whichever machine ran last" is a
permanent ping-pong and each re-freeze silently turns the other machine
red.  The three options — platform-keyed references, `atol=2e-6`, or naming
one platform authoritative — all change what the gate means.  **Not taken
here.**  Do not re-freeze them on Perlmutter to make this census green:
that is the move that produced this row.

### P2 — the chunk-width gauge cells (pre-existing)

| tests | class | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `test_bse_setup_qchunk::test_values_are_invariant_to_the_chunk_width` | (b) pre-existing | `_maxdiff = 1.374` against `< 1e-10`; red in isolation, red on WSL, red at the branch base |
| `test_bse_setup_qchunk::test_chunk_width_ulp_spread_is_reported` | (b) pre-existing | reports 5 non-zero spreads, first `(2, 2.22e-16, 2.22e-16)`, where the pin expects `[]` |

Already characterized and A/B'd at `5bb4368`; cited, not re-derived.  The
second cell is the first one's instrument and goes red with it.  On WSL the
whole file is red (12 cells) for want of an FFI; on Perlmutter exactly these
two are.

### P3 — `test_wfn_loader_eager::test_no_ffi_at_P_gt_1_refuses_and_names_both_libraries`

Class (d) environment.  The cell's own docstring says it "runs the resolver
… on a tree with no `.so` (which is this checkout)".  Under the BUILD_NOTES
pins the `.so` IS present, so the terminal refusal arm is unreachable and
the cell reports `DID NOT RAISE`.  **FALSIFIED**: the same cell with
`LORRAX_FFI_SO`/`LORRAX_FFI_HOST_SO` unset is **1 passed**.  Not a code
defect; the cell needs to neutralise the pins itself (monkeypatch
`_locate_so`, or `delenv` both) instead of assuming its checkout is bare.

### P4 — `test_staged_reshard::test_red_twin_the_unstaged_chain_emits_the_spmd_warning` (leg C)

Class (d) environment, and it is the *instrument's own* red twin, which is
why it matters more than a normal skip.  The cell asserts that the UNSTAGED
chain emits `Involuntary full rematerialization`; on this XLA it emits
nothing, so the twin fails with its own message: *"the instrument cannot go
red here, so a zero count from the staged path means nothing."*  Every other
remat gate in leg C is green — but that green is now **unfalsifiable on this
stack**.  Covering leg: none on Perlmutter; the Frontera census's leg C is
where the instrument last demonstrably worked.

### P5 — `test_aot_memory::test_predicted_peak_matches_runtime_3d_fft` (leg D, `extra`)

Class (d) environment.  `device.memory_stats()` returns `None`, so
`["peak_bytes_in_use"]` raises `TypeError`.  The site's shifter string
carries `--env=XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=platform`, and the platform
allocator keeps no arena to report — the runtime banner says so in the same
run ("The live client reports no arena accounting at all").  **FALSIFIED**:
`env XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR=bfc` on the same device returns the full
dict (`bytes_in_use, bytes_limit, …, peak_bytes_in_use, …`).  The cell
should skip-with-reason when `memory_stats()` is `None` rather than
`TypeError`.

### P6 — `test_contract_bands::test_ffi_gemm_plan` crashes the interpreter at 4 emulated devices

Class (b) pre-existing.  `SIGSEGV` inside the TEST's own numpy reference
(`test_contract_bands.py:129 _ref` → `numpy/_core/einsumfunc.py:1194
bmm_einsum`), or `SIGABRT` at `:135 _relerr` → `jax…array.__array__` when
threads are pinned.  Reproducible alone; `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` /
`MKL_NUM_THREADS=1` does not change it; deselecting only that cell leaves
the file at **8 passed**.  **PRE-EXISTING: the same cell segfaults at the
branch base `96a6399` on the same leg.**

This one costs coverage twice over: at 1 device the file's 9 device-gated
cells SKIP, and at 4 emulated devices this cell kills the process — so it
has no leg at all.  It is excluded from leg C by name, which is why leg C
has a junitxml.

## Environment-limited (skips, each with its covering leg)

Leg A, 62 skips.  Leg A2 = these 62 plus leg B's 22.

| n | reason | covering leg |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | `needs >=4 devices: XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4` (`test_staged_reshard`, `test_staged_reshard_routes`) | **C** (green) |
| 11 | `needs 4 (emulated) devices, got 1` (`test_contract_bands` 9, `test_projection_lgemm` 2) | **C** for `projection_lgemm`; `test_contract_bands` → **P6, uncovered** |
| 7 + 1 | `needs 4 devices, have 1` / `needs 2 devices, have 1` (`test_charge_zeta_route`) | **C** and **C3** (green) |
| 4 | `needs >=4 devices to build a 2x2 mesh` (`test_sharding_fit`) | **C** (green) |
| 1 | `needs >= 4 devices for a 2x2 mesh; have 1` (`test_file_io`) | **B1 — the 4-device leg aborts, so this is UNCOVERED today** |
| 1 | `device count 1 is a perfect square; the refusal arm needs a non-square count` | **C2** (1 passed at 3 devices) |
| 1 | `needs 4 (emulated) devices` (`test_sanity_gates_jax::test_check_hermitian_sharded`) | **C** (green) |
| 1 | `P=1: jax.devices()[0] IS this process's device, so the negative control cannot fire` | true P>1 srun leg; **not** the emulated legs |
| 1 | `` `lfs` unavailable here, so the stripe count cannot be read `` | none — the skip says outright it verified nothing |
| 1 | `fit_scissor still accepts the energy arrays positionally` | self-documenting deprecation skip |
| 1 | **`eqp_si_fast_ref.dat` is not frozen yet — freezing a reference is the owner's call.  A candidate generated 2026-08-07 at 04b8bba lives in `/pscratch/sd/j/jackm/si_consolidation_2026-08-07/run_fast_final/` (eqp_si_fast.dat); copy it in to enable this gate.** | **INTENTIONAL, VISIBLE.**  The 20-band fast gate.  Owner's call; NOT frozen by this census |

Leg B / E2, 22 and 3 skips:

| n | reason | covering leg |
|---|---|---|
| 19 (leg B only) | `needs >= 4 devices on platform 'cpu', have 1. Set XLA_FLAGS=… BEFORE the first jax import` | legs **F**/**G** — the real 4-process 2×2, which is the coverage these emulate |
| 2 | `slate host heev SIGSEGVs — bug L-2, see docs/dev/linalg_ffi.md` | none; pinned by the skip itself, carried by design |
| 1 | `cholesky/cusolvermp is not usable on a 1x1 gpu mesh` (needs a true-2D mesh) | leg **G** (`cusolvermp_factor_solve[2x2]` green, residual 6.0e-16) |

Leg D, 2 skips: no CrI3 6×6 30Ry SOC `WFN.h5` reachable (out-of-repo
fixture); `jax.jit` decorator-factory form unsupported on jax 0.7.0.

Legs F/G skips are the cross-platform halves — `scalapack_*` and
`batched_eigh_dispatch` are host-only and skip on G; `cusolvermp_*` are
CUDA-only and skip on F.  Between them every cell runs on one of the two.

---

## Instrument notes (how to run this suite on Perlmutter)

1. **A shifter `--env` beats your exported environment, and `XLA_FLAGS` is
   one.**  The NVIDIA jax image ships its own `XLA_FLAGS`, so
   `XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4 lx test …` arrives in
   the container as `XLA_FLAGS=  --xla_gpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true`
   and `jax.device_count()` is **1**.  The leg then SKIPS its way to green
   and looks identical to a leg that ran.  MEASURED both ways; the form that
   takes is `lx run … env XLA_FLAGS=… python3 -m pytest …`, because `env`
   runs *inside* the container.  Every emulated-multi-device leg here uses
   that form, and the first attempt (recorded, superseded) did not.
2. **`lx test` is xdist.**  One node, all GPUs, four workers, one GPU pinned
   per worker by `tests/conftest.py`.  That is the launcher class **B2** is
   about, and it is why the single-process `lx run … -m pytest` leg is the
   control for every session-fixture red.
3. **Judge by artifacts.**  Leg A exits non-zero (`srun: task 0: Exited with
   exit code 1`) and still wrote a 246 kB junitxml with 1191 cells; leg C's
   first attempt exited 139 and wrote NO xml at all.  The exit code
   distinguished neither.
4. **`pytest-timeout` is not installed in this image** — `--timeout=` is an
   `unrecognized argument` and kills the leg with exit 4.  Wrap the payload
   in `timeout N …` instead.
5. **`lx run --cpu` has no container and therefore no jax.**  The CPU L-c
   leg is `lx run -N 1 -G 4 -n 4 env JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu …`, not `--cpu`.
6. Per-leg env, verbatim, is in
   `/pscratch/sd/j/jackm/svc_distrib_la/{census,census2,recheck*,bisect*}.sh`.

## Cross-machine set-diff (WSL, jax 0.9.1, no FFI)

`96a6399` → `d5cac09`, `python -m pytest -q -p no:randomly`, whole branch:
**1420 → 1441 collected, 95 → 95 red, identical ids, 0 removed, 0 newly
red.**  The WSL leg cannot see any of B1/B2 (no FFI, no CUDA) — that is
exactly why the Perlmutter census had to exist.

# Frontera CLX census, 2026-08-01 — HISTORICAL RECORD

**Kept, not deleted.**  Superseded as the tree's census by the Perlmutter
one above; still the authority for what Frontera CPU measured, and the
document class **P1** is measured against.

Complete `python -m pytest tests/` census on Frontera CLX (in-container,
required-FFI defaults, host .so `build_host_MRG`), 2026-08-01, tree
`bbe6e56` + the fixes committed with that census.  Authoritative run:
**job 7885154** (junit XMLs + run dirs under
`/scratch2/08271/jackmc/pytest_p11/`).  Job 7885150 was the first attempt
and is superseded — its 97 failures were dominated by an instrument error
(see "Instrument notes"), kept only as evidence.

## Verdicts by leg (job 7885154)

| leg | invocation | result |
|---|---|---|
| A2: full suite, bare, 1 device | `pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_ffi_linalg_contract.py` | 24 failed / 735 passed / 56 skipped / 26 deselected |
| B2: FFI linalg contract | `srun --mpi=pmi2 -n1` + `config/frontera/mpi_transport_env.sh`, `pytest tests/test_ffi_linalg_contract.py` | **0 failed** / 27 passed / 25 skipped |
| C: 4-device leg | `XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=4`, the 9 device-hungry files | 1 failed / 144 passed / 2 skipped |
| C2: nonsquare refusal | `...device_count=2`, `-k nonsquare` | 1 passed |
| D: extra tier | `-m extra`, 4 devices | 0 failed / 21 passed / 5 skipped |

> **The A2/B2 invocations above are RECORDED AS RUN (job 7885154) and are no
> longer runnable as written.** `tests/test_ffi_linalg_contract.py` moved to
> `services/distrib_la/tests/test_distrib_la_contract.py` and carries the
> `distrib_la` marker, so naming a path is no longer the way to include or
> exclude it. Today the same two legs are
> `pytest tests/ --no-services` and `srun --mpi=pmi2 -n1` +
> `config/frontera/mpi_transport_env.sh` + `pytest -m distrib_la`.
> `tests/conftest.py` owns those hooks and `tests/test_service_selection.py`
> measures that they select what they claim.

Every leg-A2 failure below was triaged; after the fixes in that commit
the only remaining red was the ring-vma class.

## KNOWN FAILURES (ship-listed, as of 2026-08-01)

| tests | class | evidence | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 ring-transport tests: `test_bse_dense_reference` `{w_positive_control,full_H,DV}[ring]` + `test_nontda_matvec_matches_dense_shao` + `test_nontda_solver_reproduces_dense`, `test_bse_stack_matvec::test_stack_memory_flat_in_n_trials`, `test_bse_w0_resolvent` (2), `test_bse_w_omega_chain` (2) | (b) pre-existing — the old handoff's "bse_ring_comm vma", verified present at that HEAD and now precisely diagnosed | `TypeError: scan body ... carry ... {V:(x,y)} varying manual axes` at `src/bse/bse_ring_comm.py:382` (`_apply_V_ring_only` fori_loop carry `A0` unannotated; jax's error prescribes `lax.pvary` on the initial carry). junitA2_7885154. Serial + simple matvec arms PASS, so the dense-reference physics is still covered; only the ring transport arm is dark | **CLOSED on Perlmutter/jax 0.7.0**: all 10 pass in the single-process `iso_bse` leg of the 2026-08-07 census. The Frontera/jax-version scope of the original diagnosis is unretracted |
| `test_ffi_linalg_contract` under a BARE (no-srun) launch with the host .so loadable: silent interpreter death at import | (d) environment — MPI init without PMI2 glue | CLAIMS 30; reproduced 7885125 step1 (srun WITHOUT transport env also dies). **Upgrade that census added: with `mpi_transport_env.sh` sourced under `srun --mpi=pmi2 -n1` the pytest form is fully GREEN (leg B2, 27 passed)** — the CLI matrix is no longer the only instrument | Not a code bug; invocation contract. The bare leg must deselect the service (`--no-services`); the srun+transport leg (`-m distrib_la`) covers it. On Perlmutter neither death occurs: leg B is 130 cells / 0 failed under plain `lx test` |
| `test_centroid_distribution::test_orbit_path_with_trivial_group_matches_plain_path` | (d) environment — reproduces ONLY on an UNSUPPORTED jax. Corrected 2026-08-05: an earlier revision of this row claimed the defect was version-independent; direct measurement disproved that, see evidence | `jax.errors.UnexpectedTracerError`: an `int64[]` tracer whose creating frame is `src/centroid/orbit_syms.py:241` at **`<module>` scope** escapes the jit of `kmeans_pp_init` (`src/centroid/kmeans_isdf.py:585`) and is raised out of the Lloyd loop at `src/centroid/kmeans_isdf.py:738`. Only the orbit-on (`R=`/`Rinv=`/`tau=`) branch trips. **Seen only under the Shifter image's bundled jax 0.5.3** (Perlmutter GPU census, jobid 56385965, `pytest_gpu.log`: 7 failed / 920 passed). Under the SUPPORTED jax the same test **passes** | Still a **tripwire**, and it did not fire: the 2026-08-07 Perlmutter census runs `lorrax_J070` (jax 0.7.0.dev20260807) and `test_centroid_distribution` is green in legs A, A2 and C |

## Environment-limited on Frontera (skips, each with its covering leg)

| tests | reason | coverage |
|---|---|---|
| 45 device-count skips (leg A2): `test_staged_reshard` (14), `test_staged_reshard_routes` (18), `test_charge_zeta_route` (7), `test_sharding_fit` (4), `test_collectives_distribution`, `test_centroid_distribution`, `test_sanity_gates_jax::test_check_hermitian_sharded` | need >=2/4 emulated devices | leg C (all green after the fix below); nonsquare-refusal cell needs a NON-square count → leg C2 (green) |
| `test_centroid_distribution::test_process_local_mesh_is_addressable` negative control | needs true multi-PROCESS (P>1), not emulated devices | P>1 srun leg (P1 scaling legs); `tests/multi_device/` is likewise srun-driven, never pytest-collected |
| `test_bse_kgrid` (7), `test_wfn_loader_eager[mos2]` (3), `test_R_proper_cri3` (1, extra tier) | fixtures pinned to `/pscratch/...` — Perlmutter, machine gone | RESOLVED for the first two by running on Perlmutter: `test_bse_kgrid` and `test_wfn_loader_eager[mos2]` are collected and (single-process) green in the 2026-08-07 census |
| 23 CUDA cells in `test_ffi_linalg_contract`, `-m gpu`-dependent extras (3 cufft + 1 CUDA backend in leg D) | need a CUDA jax backend | P1 GPU leg (rtx); on Perlmutter these are the leg-B cells that run |
| `test_slate_cholesky_trsm_cpu` heev cells (2 skips in leg B2) | slate host heev SIGSEGV — documented bug L-2, `docs/dev/linalg_ffi.md` | pre-existing, pinned by the skip itself; SAME 2 skips on Perlmutter (legs B, E2) |
| 26 deselected (`-m extra` tier) | deselected by repo `addopts` default | leg D ran them: 21 passed / 5 skipped |

## Fixed in the Frontera pass (committed with `f485b5a`)

| tests | root cause | fix | validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_file_io` (12) + `test_compute_all_V_q_g_flat::test_..._rejects_r_space_loader` | (c) stale builders: synthetic `zeta_q.h5` helpers never stamped `zeta_is_done`, and `ZetaLoader` now refuses partial files at open (completeness gate) | builders stamp done (complete synthetic payloads); the flag-behaviour tests pass `zeta_is_done=False` explicitly | GREEN in 7885154 leg A2, and GREEN on Perlmutter |
| `test_zq_from_psi_sm_bit_identity` (6) | (c) `_MockPsiGStore` missing `_bpd_per_bc` | mock mirrors `psi_G_store.py:147` | GREEN in 7885154 leg A2, and GREEN on Perlmutter |
| `test_sigma_ppm_gates::test_g2_branch_window_tiles_are_frozen` | (c) stale pin: G2 npz frozen 2026-07-07; `d011a36` reconditioned the Σc HGL crossing quadrature — crossing-core node ladder changed 103→98 | regenerated via `_regenerate_g2_reference()` (job 7885154 step 0, CPU/f64) | GREEN on Frontera — **and RED on Perlmutter, where the ladder is 100. See class P1** |
| `test_gw_jax_regression::test_gnppm_matches_reference`, `::test_bispinor_gnppm_matches_reference` | platform-migrated pins: refs frozen on Perlmutter GPU (b7654ee); on Frontera CPU/FFI the drift is EXACTLY one unit in the 6th printed decimal (max delta 1.000e-6 eV, sigC/sigXC only; 20/2484 resp. 24/1620 rows) against `atol=1e-6` | re-froze both `sigma_diag_*_ref.dat` from the job-7885154 session outputs | **This is the move class P1 documents. The re-freeze relocated the red rather than removing it: on Perlmutter the same 20/2484 and 24/1620 rows are now off by the same 1.000e-6, and the pre-`f485b5a` reference is bit-equal to what Perlmutter produces today** |
| `test_runtime_distributed::test_set_default_env_defaults` | (a) real gap in `skip_gpu_plugin_discovery` | both branches re-apply the demotion pinning | GREEN on Perlmutter (legs A, A2) |
| `test_charge_zeta_route::test_rank_truncate_refuses_rather_than_downgrading` (leg C) | (c) stale pin vs the R15.1 widening | refusal case moved to `_OVER_FACTOR_CAP` (μ=17000) | GREEN on Perlmutter legs C and C3 |
| `test_contract_bands` (9) + `test_projection_lgemm` (2) failing at 1 device | test defect: `assert n_dev >= 4` instead of the suite-wide `pytest.skip` | `_mesh()` skips below 4 devices | GREEN under Frontera leg C; on Perlmutter `test_projection_lgemm` is green and `test_contract_bands` hits class P6 |

## Old-handoff known-fail list, as verified 2026-08-01

| handoff item | verdict |
|---|---|
| file-IO fixtures | root-caused (zeta_is_done completeness gate vs stale test builders) and FIXED |
| bse_ring_comm vma | present on Frontera/jax at that tree; **not reproducible on Perlmutter / jax 0.7.0 (2026-08-07)** |
| kmeans multi-rank segfault | not reproducible in pytest scope; P>1 thread-main refusal FIXED repo-side (24e4dc3, subsumed e97e8ed); true multi-process kmeans belongs to the P>1 srun leg |
| GN-PPM pred remat | remat gates ALL GREEN in Frontera leg C (32 tests). **On Perlmutter the gates are green but their RED TWIN is dead — see class P4** |

## Frontera instrument notes (the 7885150 lesson)

1. Export the environment INSIDE the container: apptainer does not forward
   the host `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and without it the required-FFI gate
   refuses (`libhdf5.so.310` unresolvable) — that single mistake produced
   68 failed + 29 errors in job 7885150.  Pattern: job script
   `/scratch2/08271/jackmc/pytest_p11/run_pytest2.sbatch`.
2. The `distrib_la` service suite must be DESELECTED in the bare leg
   (`pytest tests/ --no-services`; import-time death without PMI2 glue)
   and run under `srun --mpi=pmi2 -n1` with
   `config/frontera/mpi_transport_env.sh` sourced (`pytest -m distrib_la`)
   — green there.  Deselect through the hook, never through a second
   `-m`: `pyproject` sets `addopts = "-m 'not extra'"` and an explicit
   `-m` REPLACES it, silently re-enabling the whole `extra` tier.
3. Per-test timeout: `pytest-timeout` staged on `PYTHONPATH`
   (`--timeout=2400 --timeout-method=signal`); do NOT also pass
   `-p pytest_timeout` (double registration).  It is NOT installed in the
   Perlmutter image — see Perlmutter instrument note 4.
4. e2e regression fixtures run the drivers on the CPU node via
   `ISDF_COHSEX_TEST_PLATFORM=auto` (jax native pick); compile cache under
   `$SCRATCH` keeps the whole suite ~21 min.

# eqp0.dat / eqp1.dat mix two bases on the self-consistent path

OPEN, UNMEASURED, 2026-08-05.  Carried forward unchanged; neither census
touches it.  `gw_jax.py:652-654` reads `sigma_c_omega_kij_ry` off the object
`run_sc_driver` returns and emits its diagonal as `sigma_c_omega_diag_ev`.
That field is in the QP basis and is correct there — Σ is Hermitised as
½(Σ(E_n)+Σ(E_m)), which only means anything in the basis whose eigenvalues
are those E_n, so it must not be rotated.  The finalize rotates the five
static Σ fields to the DFT basis and carries the cube through unrotated,
which is deliberate.

The defect is downstream: `compute_eqp_diag` forms
`Δ = kin_ion + V_H + Σ_x + Σ_c(E_DFT) − E_DFT` from three DFT-basis
diagonals plus that one QP-basis diagonal.  The sum is basis-consistent
only at U = identity.  `write_results` is unguarded, so both files are
written on the SC path (unlike `eqp_g0w0.dat`, guarded at
`gw_output.py:846`).  The same mixing reaches `sigma_xc_at_dft_ev`
(`gw_jax.py:600-603`).

The error scales with ‖U − 1‖ and NO ONE HAS MEASURED IT.  To measure:
read `U_mnk` from an SC run's `qp_wfn_rotations.h5`, report the largest
off-diagonal element, and bound the eqp error by the off-diagonal Σ weight
it mixes in.  One-shot runs are unaffected — `solve_qp` is reached only in
the non-SC branch (`gw_jax.py:543`), where the whole object is DFT basis.

`tests/test_sigma_result_basis.py` pins which field is in which basis, so
a new Σ channel cannot join the wrong group silently.  It does not and
cannot catch this: the mixing is in the consumer, not the declaration.
